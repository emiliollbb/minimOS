; ** start of ROM **

; ** I/O definitions **

; I/O base address, usually one page, new 20160308

VIA2	=	VIA1			; Jalapa is a single-VIA machine, others may change
VIA		=	VIA1			; for compatibility with older code

; ** new separate VIAs in some machines **
; VIA_J is the one which does the jiffy IRQ, most likely the main one
; VIA_FG is the one for audio generation (/PB7 & CB2)
; VIA_SS is the one for SS-22 interface

; ** jiffy interrupt frequency **
