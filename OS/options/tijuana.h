VIA		=	VIA1			; for compatibility with older code

; ** new separate VIAs in some machines **
; VIA_J is the one which does the jiffy IRQ, most likely the main one
; VIA_FG is the one for audio generation (/PB7 & CB2)
; VIA_SS is the one for SS-22 interface
; VIA_SP is the one for SPI interface (TBD)
