	PHX

; switch DBR to bank zero!!!! but not really needed as JMP[abs] takes the pointer from bank zero
;	PHK					; push a zero... (3+4)
;	PLB					; ...as current data bank!
; in case an unaware 6502 app installs a handler ending in RTS,
; stack imbalance will happen, best keep SP and reset afterwards

; first copy vector into zeropage, as per long-indirect requirement
