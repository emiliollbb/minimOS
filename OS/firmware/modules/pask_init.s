	ORA #%00001010		; set CA1 negative, CA2 pulse (for actual PASK, might be removed as no ACK is needed)
; simplified version for actual PASK
;	AND #%11111110		; keep unrelated bits and set CA1 negative
	STA VIA_U+PCR		; set handshake configuration
	LDA VIA_U+ACR		; let us enable latching
	ORA #1				; only needs to set bit 0
	STA VIA_U+ACR		; ready for latched input
; the very basic FW drivers polls IFR until bit 1 is set
; otherwise, a suitable async interrupt task should put IORA on a FIFO for later CIN/BLIN read
; but I do not think is really worth it! Polling should do fine.
	LDA #2				; disable CA1 interrupt (unlike a full driver!)
	STA VIA_U+IER		; all done
