; *** basic initialisation ***
; assumed to start at 'reset' label (in template file)
; NMOS and 65816 savvy
; no interface needed

-reset:
	SEI				; cold boot, best assume nothing (2)
	CLD				; just in case, a must for NMOS (2)
; * this is in case a 65816 is being used, but still compatible with all *
	SEC				; would set back emulation mode on C816
	.byt	$FB		; XCE on 816, NOP on C02, but illegal 'ISC $0005, Y' on NMOS!
	ORA $0			; the above would increment some random address in zeropage (NMOS) but this one is inocuous on all CMOS
; * end of 65816 specific code *
	LDX #SPTR		; initial stack pointer, machine-dependent, must be done in emulation for '816 (2)
	TXS				; initialise stack (2)
