;	INPUT
; Y <-	char to be printed (1...255)
;	supported control codes in this version
;		0	= ask for one character (non-locking)
;		1	= start of line (CR withput LF, eg. set Y to one so DEY sets Z and skips LF routine)
;		2	= cursor left
;		6	= cursor right
;		7	= beep
;		8	= backspace
;		9	= TAB (x+8 MOD 8 in any case)
;		10	= line feed (cursor down, direct jump needs no Y set)
;		11	= cursor up
;		12	= clear screen AND initialise device
;		13	= newline (actually LF after CR, eg. set Y to anything but 1 so DEY clears Z and does LF)
;		14	= inverse video
;		15	= true video
;		16	= DLE, do not execute next control char
;		17	= cursor on (no cursor yet?) actually show current position for a split second
;		18	= set ink colour (MOD 16 for colour mode, hires will set it as well but will be ignored)*
;		19	= cursor off (no cursor yet, simply IGNORED)
;		20	= set paper colour (ditto)*
;		21	= home without clear
;		23	= set cursor position**
;		31	= back to text mode (simply IGNORED)
; commands marked * will take a second char as parameter
; command marked ** takes two subsequent bytes as parameters
; *** NOT YET supported (will show glyph like after DLE) ***
