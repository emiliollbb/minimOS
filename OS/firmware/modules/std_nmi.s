; placeholder, just enable interrupts and return
	TSX				; get current stack pointer
	LDA $010A, X	; in order to get P from the stack (jsr, 4@sysptr, 4regs!)
	AND #%11110011	; remove interrupt mask & decimal mode bits
	STA $010A, X	; ints will be restored upon exit
	RTS				; back to handler end, hopefully everything settled now
; as all 6502 code runs from bank 0, RTS is OK thru 65816 firmware...
; however, as this peeks into stack, this is only 8-bit FW compatible
