# Hardware for minimOS

## Supported architectures

With great embarrassment I have to admit never having owned a 65xx computer...
but suport for these classic machines shouldn't be difficult to add -- for
instance, I have declared as 'reserved' the two first zero-page bytes in case
the utterly popular Commodore-64 (using a 6510) is targeted. Back to my
**own-designed** machines, here's the current history & roadmap:

### Computers

Status: finished and _sort-of_ working, but with some strange malfunction :-(

Form-factor: Breadboard with point-to-point soldering.

Specs: Soldered, compact version of SDd. Strange bug with VIA, not solved yet.
*Likely to be discarded*.

Interfaces: Piezo buzzer between PB7-CB2, SS-22 and old *VIAport* connectors.

RTC 146818.

Interfaces: Amplified piezo buzzer between PB7-CB2, Hitachi LCD, TTL-level RS-232,
SS-22 and old *VIAport* connectors. Several diagnostic LEDs.




**Baja**

Status: never started :-(

Specs: intended to be a *fully bankswitching* 65C02 **SBC**, but also pluggable into a backplane.




[**Jalapa (formerly _SDm_)**](jalapa2.md)

Status: **almost finished** design, heavily *revamped* as of Oct-2018.

Form-factor: Breadboard with point-to-point soldering.

Specs: 1.8432 / 2.304 MHz **65C816**, 128 kiB RAM (or 512K),
up to 32 kiB *Kernel* EPROM plus up to 512 kiB *library* EPROM,
VIA 65C22, ACIA 65SC51.

Intefaces: Amplified piezo buzzer between PB7-CB2, SS-22, new *VIAport*
(*SBC-2* style but with "mirrored" power pins), TTL-level RS-232,
*VME-like* slot (65816 direct expansion)




[**Acapulco**](acapulco.md)

Status: finishing design.

Form-factor: Breadboard with point-to-point soldering.

Specs: 1.536 MHz 65C02, 32 kiB SRAM (plus 1 kiB
in parallel as *attribute area*, 
32 kiB EPROM, VIA 65C22, CRTC HD6445.
*Intended to be a colour & graphics capable SBC.*

Interfaces: Piezo buzzer, SS-22, new VIA connector,
VGA-compatible video output (320x200 @ 16 colours
in GRgB mode, only 2 of them each 8x8 pixels)




[**miniPET**](minipet.md)

Status: finishing design.

Form-factor: Breadboard with point-to-point soldering.

Specs: 1.57 MHz 65(C)02, 32 kiB SRAM (plus 2 kiB *VRAM*, 
up to 32 kiB EPROM, VIA 65(C)22, PIA 6521/6821,
CRTC HD6845, with *optional second PIA*.

_This is a recreation of the `Commodore PET 8032`
**switchable between 40 and 80 columns**_, with more
modern components (e.g. SRAM) and **VGA-compatible**
output.

Interfaces: **same as the original PET**; cassette and
IEEE-488 on separate _optional_ boards.




**Tijuana**

Status: finishing design.

Form-factor: Single layer PCB?

Specs: 6.144 MHz 65C816, 16 kiB SRAM (plus 16 more for *ROM-in-RAM*, 3x32 kiB VRAM,
16 kiB EPROM, VIA 65C22, CRTC HD46505, ACIA 6551A. *Intended to be a
colour & graphics capable VT-52 based terminal.*

Interfaces: Piezo buzzer, TTL-level async., SS-22, parallel input,
VGA-compatible video output (576x448 @ 1 bpp, 3-bit RGB or 3-bit greyscale),
*VME-like* slot (65816 direct expansion) 




**Veracruz**

Status: in design stage

Form-factor: ?

Specs: 4 MHz (at least) 65816, 512 kiB RAM, 32 kiB *Kernel* EPROM, 512 kiB *lib* EPROM,
2 x VIA 65C22, UART 16C550, RTC MC146818.

Interfaces: Piezo buzzer, new VIA and SS-22 connectors, TTL-level async,
**65SIB**, Hitachi LCD thru VIA, maybe *I2C*, *VME-like* slot (65816 direct expansion)




**Jalisco**

Status: in design stage

Form-factor: 4-layer PCB, SMD components.

Specs: 12 MHz (I hope!) 65816, up to **8 MiB RAM** (2 x Garth's modules),
32 kiB Kernel + 2 MiB *lib* EPROM, 2 x VIA 65C22, (2x) UART.

Interfaces: most likely those of Veracruz, possibly plus SD-card,
text console (or graphic) output...




**SIXtation**

Status: in design stage

Form-factor: 4-layer PCB, SMD components.

Specs: 10.7 MHz 65816, up to **8 MiB RAM** (2 x Garth's modules),
32 kiB Kernel + 4 MiB *lib* EPROM, 2 x VIA 65C22, (2x) UART.

Video output: 6445-based, _planar_ 1 MiB VRAM, up to **8 bpp**, typically **1360x768**.

Other interfaces: most likely those of Jalisco, possibly adding CF & SD-card.


### Peripherals (TBD)
