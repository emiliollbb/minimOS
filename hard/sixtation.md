# SIXtation

A powerful **_65816-based_ graphic workstation** inspired by the _3M-compliant_ (1 MByte,
1 MegaPixel, 1 MIPS) computers of the early 80s (Sun-1, SGI IRIS 1000...)

## Specifications

- CPU: 65816 @ **9 MHz** (~2.5 MIPS) or **13.5 MHz** on the _Turbo_ version (~4 MIPS)
- FPU: 68881 @ **24.576 MHz** or faster\* (~0.236 MFLOPS, perhaps up to **0.35 MFLOPS**)
- VDU: 6445 based, **1360x768**, up to 8 bpp
- RAM: **1 MiB** on board, two _Garth Wilson's_ slots (up to **8 MiB**, 5 MiB possible)
- ROM: 32 kiB _Kernel_ (fully switchable), up to 4 MiB _library_
- Storage: CF & SD (possibly _bit-banged_) interfaces
- RTC (146818) and DUART (16C552)
- Usual 65xx ports, including **PS/2**, perhaps thru the use of _three_ **65C22 VIAs**.

\*) Since these FPUs may run **asynchronously** from the CPU, an independent oscillator
is provided; nonetheless, some jumpers may provide a _half_ or a _quarter_ frequency
of `DOTCLK` (**18 Mhz or 36 MHz** on the base _SIXtation_) as clock for the FPU, saving the
independent oscillator. Note that _overclocking is **not** recommended_. The main
concern is that, unkike the 68040, the 68020/030/**881/882*** have the silicon die _atop_
the ceramic PGA substrate, with an _air gap_ between it and the metallic cover, making
the use of a _heatsink_ **highly ineffective**. _Read below about the Turbo version_.

## Memory

In order to be fully _3 M compliant_, the main board is provided with **1 MiB RAM** as
standard. Then, two pin-header slots for [Garth Wilson's RAM 4 MiB cards](http://wilsonminesco.com/)
are provided. Since every 512 kiB `Chip Select` line is individually accesible, three RAM configurations
are supported:

- **1 MiB** (standard on-board RAM)
- **5 MiB** (add one Garth module, _plus the supplied megabyte_)
- **8 MiB** (needs two Garth modules, although two chips on the second module will remain unused)

Memory addresses above `$800000` will be reserved for I/O boards (including the supplied
**graphic card**) and those above `$C00000` are intended for _library_ ROM.

## Graphic card & clock

Perhaps on a separate PCB, but anyway **highly integrated** on the system. _This will generate
the main **CPU Phi-2 clock** in a fully synchronous way, for **optimum performance**_. Trying to
match the 1366/**1360 x 768** resolution of my cheap Acer widescreen monitor, which just fits the
_megapixel_ rating, the standard 85.5 MHz (85.86 MHz according to other sources) _dot clock_
is almost impossible to find from standard oscillator cans, whereas a **72 MHz** one seems
quite popular. There is a **reduced blanking** timing standard for that frequency, thus will
be the chosen master clock. _Vertical sync pulse is **positive**, while horizontal sync is negative_.

This `DOTCLK` divided by 8 will generate the **9 MHz CPU clock** (instead of the previously specced
_10.7 MHz_), and further halved will fit the maximum _4.5 MHz **HD6445 CRTC**_ clock. On the
other hand, half the dot clock (36 MHz) might work for a _slightly overclocked_ FPU (read above). Since
**all timing is derived from the _dot clock_**, the main CPU board _may lack an oscillator_,
as it will be located on the video board.

### Alternative video modes

On the other hand, a somewhat reduced resolution of **800 x 864** should be compatible
with the _Apple Portrait Display_ (with non-square _1:1.257_ pixels, unfortunately), all
within mere software configuration. While this reduced resolution is compatible with the
Acer monitor, it is not recommended as sharpness will be sub-optimal. If the official
**57.28 MHz clock** is used, the _pixel-perfect 640x870 mode_ may be attained on the APD,
although slowing the computer down to **7.16 MHz**.

Another easily-implemented video mode is **816Ã—1024** with a pixel aspect ratio of about _1.5:1_,
which basically matches the _VESA 1280x1024 @ 60 Hz_ timing, thus well suited to my _LG 1910S_ monitor.
Due to 6445 _hsync_ timing limitations, only the equivalent width of 1224 pixels will be covered.
_Note that this mode needs a **positive** horizontal sync pulse_. On the other hand, _the APD monitor
expects **negative** syncs_, so a full-software resolution switch does not seem feasible, unless some
port bits are used for selective inversion of syncs (via XOR gates, which may be as slow as a 4000-series IC).

### SIXtation TURBO?

A further development would be a **faster** version of the SIXtation, by syncing with the _VESA 1280 x 1024 timing_,
quite suitable for my _superb LG 1910S monitor_. In order to stay within the _megapixel_ limit (which for 8bpp takes
one MiB of VRAM), 1280 x 1024 @ 60 Hz timing will be used, but restricting the visible area to **1152 x 896**. From the
standard _108 MHz dot clock_ a whopping **13.5 MHz Phi-2 clock** is achieved. Note that the CRTC must work at
_a **quarter** of Phi-2 frequency_ to stay within the 6445 limits, thus configured for 32-pixel wide "virtual"
characters. While this configuration further reduces sync and porch timing accuracy, no issues are expected thanks
to the ample borders (64 pixels both left & right, 80 top & down).

A downside effect of this new rating might be _impaired FPU performance_, as 54 MHz is _beyond any feasible overclocking_.
Taking a _quarter_ of the dot clock would result on a **27 MHz** rate, still good for 0.285 MFLOPS, and likely to be
allowed by a 25 MHz part. Thus, _the use of a **separate oscillator** for the FPU is highly recommended_.
A **32 MHz** clock on a common **68882**/33 will give nearly **0.34 MFLOPS**.

On the other hand, a faster (110 MHz) **Bt 481 _RAMDAC_** should be used, otherwise
fully compatible with slower cards.
 
### VRAM layout

Being **6445-based** (improved 6845), VRAM is organized in an _Amstrad-like_ fashion, but
with **16 scanlines per row**. While a _bitmapped_ display is optimum for performance,
colour is certainly desired. **Planar** layout is chosen for scalability.

Assuming a colour depth of **8 bits per pixel** (up to 256 colours), this needs a whopping
**1 MiB VRAM**, somewhat above the capabilities of a 65816, even at a mighty **9 MHz**.
Please note that the original _3 M_ workstations, while bearing slower CPUs (a 10 MHz
_MC 68000_ is about **2.5 times slower** than a **9 MHz 65816**), had _graphic coprocessors_
for much improved screen handling (_RasterOp_ on Sun, _Geometry Engine_ on SGI IRIS...).

The Planar layout would take several consecutive 128 kiB bitmaps, first one at `$800000-$81FFFF`.
In case of the recommended _8 bpp_ configuration, last plane would take `$8E0000-$8FFFFF` _(read
below about alternative address ranges)_.

For CRTC & RAMDAC configuration, plus the _multi-plane write selector_ register, regular I/O is
to be used (typically at page `$DF` from the first bank). **Sync inverting** flags may be addressed
in a simlar way.

Suggested I/O map:

- `$DFC0-1`: 6445 **CRTC** registers (perhaps _write-only_)
- `$DFC2-3`: **multi-plane write** selector _write_ (`A0` is not used, both addresses do the same)
- `$DFC4-5`: **multi-plane write** selector _read_ (same as above, _optional_)
- `$DFC6-7`: **sync inverting** flags (TBD, only two bits used)
- `$DFC8-F`: Bt478 **RAMDAC** registers

### Performance improvements

Despite this handicap, there is one trick from Sun graphic cards that is _easily
implemented_ and will noticeably speed-up a few operations: **multi-plane _write_**
feature. After _enabling_ the desired planes on some register (see above),
simultaneous **writes** (only) may be done on the area `$900000-$91FFFF`. _If decoding
is made simpler, **mirroring** of this multi-plane area is acceptable up to `$9FFFFF`_

While this device is perfectly capable of displaying _graphic content_, most development
tasks are expected to be done on _text windows_. With more than one bit plane installed,
these are colour capable too; but then one _software trick_ (combined with the previous
**multi-plane writes**) may _improve drawing and **scrolling** speed noticeably_.

For the sake of simplicity, let us assume an example with 4 planes following the `GRgB` model:

```
    INK: 0010 (dark green)
  PAPER: 1110 (yellow)
```

Note that both planes 0 (light green) and 1 (red) will switch on every pixel depending
whether it is foreground (clear) or background (set). Since they take **identical values**
on both set or clear pixels, the whole byte can be set _on both planes_ at once, thanks
to the aforementioned hardware feature.

However, _neither planes 2 and 3 change_, no matter what gets printed! This means that
**these planes will remain constant** (one all set, the other one all clear), thus the
system _will not bother writing or **scrolling**_ them. All combined, **only one out of
4 planes** is actually accessed by the CPU.

In order to keep track of the actually used planed, an **enable mask** is to be used.
Upon `CLRS` this mask is reset as the _exclusive-OR_ of both INK and PAPER values. From
the above example, `0010 XOR 1110 =**1100**`, leaving planes 2 and 3 untouched (after
filling them appropriately).

However, further colours may appear on that window. Those should enable further planes,
and eventually all available planes would be in use, cancelling the performance
advantage -- until a new `CLRS` is issued. These new colours should be inclusive-ORed with
the current mask. If some _dark turuqoise_ (0011) text on white appears, we could compute
a new enable mask as follows:

```
    INK: 0011 (dark turquoise) _newly set_
  PAPER: 1110 (yellow)

         0011 XOR 1110 = 1101 (temporary mask)
old mask 1100  OR 1101 = 1101 (new _enable mask_ for this setting)

    INK: 0011 (dark turquoise)
  PAPER: 1111 (white) newly set

         0011 XOR 1111 = 1100 (temporary mask)
old mask 1101  OR 1100 = 1101 (definitive enable mask)
```

Printing logic operations are equally simple. _Disabled planes_ are of course ignored and,
thanks to the multiplane writes, easily done. A _temporary mask_ as per the previous examples must be computed,
and then ANDing that with both INK and PAPER codes results on which planes will take the
_normal_ pattern (INK) and the _inverse_ pattern (PAPER).
If more than a bit is set from those AND ops, the pattern may be set at once on all of them,
thanks to the multiplane write feature. However, unaffected planes must be checked for.

For instance:

```
    INK: 0011 (dark turquoise)
  PAPER: 1111 (white) newly set

         0011 XOR 1111 = 1100 (temporary mask)
           enable mask = 1101 (previously set)

         0011 AND 1100 = 0000 (ink AND temp, no "positive" planes to be set)
         1111 AND 1100 = 1100 (paper AND temp, planes 0 & 1 to be set with INVERTED pattern)

         1100 XOR 1101 = 0001 (temp XOR mask, plane 3 is NOT unaffected!)
         0001 AND 1101 = 0001 (...AND mask, plane 3 to be filled with 1s)
```

### Palette

The _planar_ video architecture allows easy **bit-depth configuration**, either at
build time or on-the-fly. While a single bit _bitmap_ (128 kiB) leads to simple
construction and high performance, it may be easily scaled by adding more RAM chips.
Several _fixed_ palettes (both colour and greyscale) have been considered depending on
bit depth (not limited to powers of two!), but the most versatile (and relatively simple)
option is the use of a suitable **RAMDAC**, preferibly of 24-bit type. The well-known
**Bt478** RAMDAC, for instance, is **readily available**, well documented, **inexpensive**
and thus pretty adequate for this application (**80MHz** version required).

[_Suggested_ **8-bit palette**](../forge/palettes/256col+s+g.html) includes:

- **16 system colours** from the _GRgB_ scheme (like those on [_Acapulco_ display](acapulco.md))
- **16 grey entries** besides black and white _from the System colours_ (for a total of **18-level greyscale**)
- The remaining 224 entries on a _7-8-4 scheme_. **These may be changed** if required.

Keeping the first 32 entries allows a _consistent_ interface display, while providing adequate support
for photographic images.

Alternate **128 and 64-colour palettes** have been considered, starting with the aforementioned _32 system entries_
followed by the remaining 96 or 32 colours, based on a _4-4-4_ or _4-4-2_ scheme, respectively. _Note that the 128-colour palette uses only 64 out of 96 non-system colours, repeating the system colours band_.

Palette colours are arranged in such a way that
_consecutive_ entries sport **noticeable luma
difference** (typically by using the most
significant bit of the _green_ channel). This way,
the **firmware console driver** may just deal
with _plane 0_ (present on all configurations),
simplifying the driver and achieving both
**speed and adequate contrast**.

## Storage

**IDE/CF** and **SD/MMC** interfaces will be provided. The latter might be implemented on
_bit-banging_, unless the **65SPI** hardware is used. _**65SIB** is expected_, perhaps
using device 1 as the **SD interface**.

## Glue logic (_stub_)

### RAM enabling

Due to the multiple RAM configurations for this machine (see above), RAM decoding is fairly complex.
Note that the _base_ MiB is used in all configurations, thus the last megabyte on the _second_
optional module is **wasted**. _Its two highest `CE` lines may be put on the expansion bus for
**optional decoding** (under consideration)_.

In such case, an **alternative video card addressing** makes sense: putting the standard
planes at `$900000-$9FFFFF` (instead of banks `$8x`) and, if required, the _multiplane_
range at, say, `$A00000-$A1FFFF` (safely mirrored up to `$AFFFFF`) will allow a
**9 MiB RAM** configuration, making use of the wasted chips on the _second_ slot, when
installed. _The video card is responsible for generaring `/CE10` and `/CE11` on the bus
from the appropriate values at `BA3-BA7`_.
 
A couple of `74AC138` are needed for all RAM decoding. `BA3-5` are the common address lines for them,
and the set of `Enables` are wired as follows:

- `BA7` goes to both decoders' _active-low_ enable, effectively disabling RAM for _expansion card_ space.
- `BA6` goes to the "low" decoder's next _active-low_ enable, and to the "high" decoder _active-high_ enable.

The remaining enable lines are tied to `VCC` or `GND`, accordingly. Note that the slots are **not**
interchangeable, thus the 5 MiB configuration _must_ populate the "low" slot.

About the `/OE` signal on RAMs, it must be **disabled during I/O** (as the standard `$DF` I/O page conflicts),
and also when `sys` ROM is accessed _while not disabled_ -- this machine has the **ROM-in-RAM** feature.
