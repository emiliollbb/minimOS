# SIXtation

A powerful **_65816_ graphic workstation** inspired by the _3M-compliant_ (1 MByte,
1 MegaPixel, 1 MIPS) computers of the early 80s (Sun-1, SGI IRIS 1000...)

## Specifications

- CPU: 65816 @ **9 MHz** (~2.5 MIPS)
- FPU: 68882 @ **36 MHz** (~0.38 MFLOPS, slightly overclocked\*)
- VDU: 6445 based, **1360x768**, up to 8 bpp
- RAM: **1 MiB** on board, two _Garth_ slots (up to **8 MiB**, 5 MiB possible)
- ROM: 32 kiB _Kernel_, up to 4 MiB _library_
- Storage: CF & SD (possibly _bit-banged_) interfaces
- RTC (146818) and DUART (16C552)
- Usual 65xx ports, including **PS/2**

\*) A jumper may provide a 18 Mhz clock for the FPU, in case overclocking fails. The main
concern is that, unkike the 68040, the 68020/030/**881/882*** have the silicon die _atop_
the ceramic PGA substrate, with an **air gap** between it and the metallic cover, making
the use of a _heatsink_ **highly ineffective**.

## Memory

In order to be fully _3 M compliant_, the main board is provided with **1 MiB RAM** as
standard. Then, two pin-header slots for _Garth Wilson's RAM 4 MiB cards_ are provided.
Since every 512 kiB `Chip Select` line is individually accesible, three RAM configurations
are supported:

- **1 MiB** (standard on-board RAM)
- **5 MiB** (add one Garth module, plus the supplied megabyte)
- **8 MiB** (needs two Garth modules, although two chips on the second one will remain unused)

Memory addresses above `$800000` will be reserved for I/O boards (including the supplied
**graphic card**) and those above `$C00000` are intended for _library_ ROM.

## Graphic card & clock

Perhaps on a separate PCB, but anyway **highly integrated** on the system. _This will generate
the main **CPU Phi-2 clock** in a fully synchronous way, for optimum performance_. Trying to
match the 1366/**1360 x 768** resolution of my cheap Acer widescreen monitor, which just fits the
_megapixel_ rating, the standard 85.5 MHz (85.86 MHz according to other sources) _dot clock_
is almost impossible to find from standard oscillator cans, whereas a **72 MHz** one seems
quite popular. There is a **reduced blanking** timing standard for that frequency, thus will
be the chosen master clock. _Vertical sync pulse is **positive**, while horizontal sync is negative_.

Divided by 8 it will generate the **9 MHz CPU clock** (instead of the previously specced
_10.7 MHz_), and further halved will fit the maximum _4.5 MHz **HD6445** CRTC_ clock. On the
other hand, half the dot clock (36 MHz) might work for a _slightly overclocked_ FPU. Since
**all timing is derived from the _dot clock_**, the main CPU board _may lack an oscillator_,
as it will be located on the video board.

### Alternative video modes

On the other hand, a somewhat reduced resolution of **800 x 864** should be compatible
with the _Apple Portrait Display_ (with non-square _1:1.257_ pixels, unfortunately), all
within mere software configuration. While this reduced resolution is compatible with the
Acer monitor, it is not recommended as sharpness will be sub-optimal. If the official
**57.28 MHz clock** is used, the _pixel-perfect 640x870 mode_ may be attained on the APD,
although slowing the computer down to **7.16 MHz**.

Another easily-implemented video mode is **816Ã—1024** with a pixel aspect ratio of about _1.5:1_,
which basically matches the _VESA 1280x1024 @ 60 Hz_ timing, thus well suited to my _LG 1910S_ monitor.
Due to 6445 _hsync_ timing limitations, only the equivalent width of 1224 pixels will be covered.
_Note that this mode needs a **positive** horizontal sync pulse_. On the other hand, _the APD monitor
expects **negative** syncs_, so a full-software resolution switch does not seem feasible, unless some
port bits are used for selective inversion of syncs (via XOR gates).

### SIXtation TURBO?

A further development would be a **faster** version of the SIXtation, by syncing with the _VESA 1280 x 1024 timing_,
quite suitable for my _superb LG 1910S monitor_. In order to stay within the _megapixel_ limit (which for 8bpp takes
one MiB of VRAM), 1280 x 1024 @ 60 Hz timing will be used, but restricting the visible area to **1152 x 864**. From the
standard _108 MHz dot clock_ a whopping **13.5 MHz Phi-2 clock** is achieved. Note that the CRTC must work at
_*a quarter* of Phi-2 frequency_ to keep within the 6445 limits, thus configured for 32-pixel wide "virtual"
characters. While this configuration further reduces sync and porch timing accuracy, no issues are expected thanks
to the ample borders (64 pixels both left & right, 80 top & down).

A downside effect of this new rating is **impaired FPU performance**, as 54 MHz is _beyond any feasible overclocking_.
Once again, taking a quarter of the dot clock would result on a **27 MHz** rate, still good for 0.285 MFLOPS. This
clock rate is likely to be allowed by a 25 MHz part.

### VRAM layout

Being **6445-based** (improved 6845), VRAM is organized in an _Amstrad-like_ fashion, but
with **16 scanlines per row**. While a _bitmapped_ display is optimum for performance,
colour is certainly desired. **Planar** layout is chosen for scalability.

Assuming a colour depth of **8 bits per pixel** (up to 256 colours), this needs a whopping
**1 MiB VRAM**, somewhat above the capabilities of a 65816, even at a mighty **9 MHz**.
Please note that the original _3 M_ workstations, while bearing slower CPUs (a 10 MHz
_MC 68000_ is about **2.5 times slower** than a **9 MHz 65816**), had _graphic coprocessors_
for much improved screen handling (_RasterOp_ on Sun, _Geometry Engine_ on SGI IRIS...).

The Planar layout would take several consecutive 128 kiB bitmaps, first one at `$800000-$81FFFF`.
In case of the recommended _8 bpp_ configuration, last plane would take `$8E0000-$8FFFFF`. Some
addresses should be taken after that for CRTC & RAMDAC configuration (see below).

### Performance improvements

Despite this handicap, there is one trick from Sun graphic cards that is _easily
implemented_ and will noticeably speed-up a few operations: the ability to _write on more
than one bit plane **simultaneously**_. After _enabling_ the desired planes on some register
(see above) simultaneous **writes** (only) may be done on the area `$900000-$91FFFF`.

While this device is perfectly capable of displaying _graphic content_, most development
tasks are expected to be done on _text windows_. With more than one bit plane installed,
these are colour capable too; but then one _software trick_ (combined with the previous
**multi-plane writes**) may _improve drawing and **scrolling** speed noticeably_.

For the sake of simplicity, let us assume an example with 4 planes following the `GRgB` model:
```
    INK: 0010 (dark green)
  PAPER: 1110 (yellow)
```

Note that both planes 0 (light green) and 1 (red) will switch on every pixel depending
whether it is foreground (clear) or background (set). Since they take **identical values**
on both set or clear pixels, the whole byte can be set _on both planes_ at once, thanks
to the aforementioned hardware feature.

However, _neither planes 2 and 3 change_, no matter what gets printed! This means that
**these planes will remain constant** (one all set, the other one all clear), thus the
system _will not bother writing or **scrolling**_ them. All combined, **only one out of
4 planes** is actually accessed by the CPU.

In order to keep track of the actually used planed, an **enable mask** is to be used.
Upon `CLRS` this mask is reset as the _exclusive-OR_ of both INK and PAPER values. From
the above example, `0010 XOR 1110 =**1100**`, leaving planes 2 and 3 untouched (after
filling them appropriately).

However, further colours may appear on that window. Those should enable further planes,
and eventually all available planes would be in use, cancelling the performance
advantage -- until a new `CLRS` is issued. These new colours should be inclusive-ORed with
the current mask. If some _dark turuqoise_ (0011) text on white appears, we could compute
a new enable mask as follows:

```
    INK: 0011 (dark turquoise) _newly set_
  PAPER: 1110 (yellow)

         0011 XOR 1110 = 1101 (temporary mask)
old mask 1100  OR 1101 = 1101 (new _enable mask_ for this setting)

    INK: 0011 (dark turquoise)
  PAPER: 1111 (white) newly set

         0011 XOR 1111 = 1100 (temporary mask)
old mask 1101  OR 1100 = 1101 (definitive enable mask)
``

Printing logic operations are equally simple. _Disabled planes_ are of course ignored and,
thanks to the multiplane writes, easily done. A _temporary mask_ as per the previous examples must be computed,
and then ANDing that with both INK and PAPER codes results on which planes will take the
_normal_ pattern (INK) and the _inverse_ pattern (PAPER).
If more than a bit is set from those AND ops, the pattern may be set at once on all of them,
thanks to the multiplane write feature. However, unaffected planes must be checked for.

For instance:
```
    INK: 0011 (dark turquoise)
  PAPER: 1111 (white) newly set

         0011 XOR 1111 = 1100 (temporary mask)
           enable mask = 1101 (previously set)

         0011 AND 1100 = 0000 (ink AND temp, no "positive" planes to be set)
         1111 AND 1100 = 1100 (paper AND temp, planes 0 & 1 to be set with INVERTED pattern)

         1100 XOR 1101 = 0001 (temp XOR mask, plane 3 is NOT unaffected!)
         0001 AND 1101 = 0001 (...AND mask, plane 3 to be filled with 1s)
``

### Palette

The _planar_ video architecture allows easy **bit-depth configuration**, either at
build time or on-the-fly. While a single bit _bitmap_ (128 kiB) leads to simple
construction and high performance, it may be easily scaled by adding more RAM chips.
Several _fixed_ palettes (both colour and greyscale) have been considered depending on
bit depth (not limited to powers of two!), but the most versatile (and relatively simple)
option is the use of a suitable **RAMDAC**, preferibly of 24-bit type. The well-known
**Bt478** RAMDAC, for instance, is **readily available**, well documented, **inexpensive**
and thus pretty adequate for this application (**80MHz** version required).

[_Suggested_ **8-bit palette**](../forge/palettes/256col+s+g.html) includes:

- **16 system colours** from the _GRgB_ scheme (like those on [_Acapulco_ display](acapulco.md))
- **16 grey entries** besides black and white _from the System colours_ (for a total of **18-level greyscale**)
- The remaining 224 entries on a _7-8-4 scheme_. **These may be changed** if required.

Keeping the first 32 entries allows a _consistent_ interface display, while providing adequate support
for photographic images.

## Storage

**IDE/CF** and **SD/MMC** interfaces will be provided. The latter might be implemented on
_bit-banging_, unless the **65SPI** hardware is used. 

## Glue logic (_stub_)

### RAM enabling

Due to the multiple RAM configurations for this machine, RAM decoding is fairly complex. Initially,
we can have:

- **1 MiB _on board_**, to make it _3M-compliant_.
- **5 MiB**, the base MiB plus one [_4 MiB module from Garth Wilson_](http://wilsonminesco.com/).
- **8 MiB**, using _**two** 4 MiB modules_.

Note that the _base_ MiB is used in all configurations, thus the last megabyte
on the _second_ module is **wasted**. _Its last `CE` lines may be put on the expansion bus for
**optional decoding**_.

A couple of `74AC138` are needed for all RAM decoding. `BA3-5` are the common address lines for them,
and the set of `Enables` are wired as follows:

- `BA7` goes to both decoders' _active-low_ enable, effectively disabling RAM for _expansion card_ space.
- `BA6` goes to the "low" decoder's next _active-low_ enable, and to the "high" decoder _active-high_ enable.

The remaining enable lines are tied to `VCC` or `GND`, accordingly. Note that the slots are **not**
interchangeable, the 5 MiB configuration _must_ populate the "low" slot.

About the `/OE` signal on RAMs, it must be **disabled during I/O** (as the standard `$DF` I/O page conflicts),
and also when `sys` ROM is accessed _while not disabled_ -- this machine has the **ROM-in-RAM** feature.
