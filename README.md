#### Minimalistic, portable, scalable Operating System for everything from embedded devices to (quasi) full-featured desktop computers!

## Purpose
Currently in a VERY early development stage, hopefully will become a common reference platform for deployment of computer-related appliances -- think about embedded systems, like the original intent: an Actual Exposure Time Meter for classic photographic cameras. But by virtue of its modularity and scalability would equally serve to a whole breed of home-made, retro-inspided computers.

## Future ports
Initial target is the venerable 65(C)02 and its big brother, the 16-bit enabled 65816 (port known as minimos·16) which will keep compatibility with existing '02 code. But other ports to many CPU architectures are in mind, like the Motorola 68xx / Hitachi 63xx series (minimOS·63, with the interesting 6809/6309 branch as minimOS·69), 680x0 (minimOS·68), 8080/8085/Z80 (minimOS·80), even (God forbid! :-) the commonly used x86 (minimOS·86). I really have little-to-no knowledge about this CPU family, nor about the usual IBM-based PC architecture; hopefully someone will be able to port minimOS without too much of a chore, that would give a very interesting 'breath' to (otherwise useless) older PCs.
