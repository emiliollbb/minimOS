#The *Forge*

This is where *ideas* for **future software** are developed. Usually written in *C* for convenience, or even *pseudo-code*, should sooner or later be re-written in **assembly language** for optimum performance.

Some of these will eventually get **integrated** into the *kernel* or associated software pieces (*shell*, etc), some others will end as standalone apps.
